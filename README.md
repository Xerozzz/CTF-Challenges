# CTF Challenges
A repo of the CTF challenges I made myself for fun and experience! Each challenge is labelled with varying difficulties of Beginner, Easy, Medium and Hard. Take note these difficulties are all geared towards beginners as I am no pro myself as well. 
Unfortunately, for now there is no way to do a input check for the flag, maybe in the future I will create a simple front end just for flag checking. For now, the flag will be stored in a separate file in the challenge folder, labelled "flag.txt". 
To attempt a challenge, navigate to the challenge folder, where you will see a README with the challenge as well as a flag.txt and any other additional files required for the challenge
Feel free to try out each one and suggest any improvements too, any feedback is greatly appreciated!
All flag formats are in myCTF{}
