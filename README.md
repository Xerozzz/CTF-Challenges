# CTF Challenges
A repo of the CTF challenges I made myself for fun and experience! Each challenge is labelled with varying difficulties of Beginner, Easy, Medium and Hard. Take note these difficulties are all geared towards beginners as I am no pro myself as well. Harder challenges may require a mix of techniques, for example, mixing cryptography with forensics, these challenges will be grouped according to what their first step is.

<br>
Unfortunately, for now there is no way to do a input check for the flag, maybe in the future I will create a simple front end just for flag checking. For now, the flag will be stored in a separate file in the challenge folder, labelled "flag.txt". 
To attempt a challenge, navigate to the challenge folder, where you will see a README with the challenge as well as a flag.txt and any other additional files required for the challenge

<br>To make it easier, all flags will be in a readable format to humans and will NOT contain random gibberish unless otherwise stated in the challenge's README file, some examples include:
- myCTF{Test_Flag!}
- myCTF{Te5t_F1ag!}

Feel free to try out each one and suggest any improvements too, any feedback is greatly appreciated!<br>
All flag formats are in myCTF{}
